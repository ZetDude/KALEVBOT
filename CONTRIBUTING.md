Thank you for any contributions you plan to make! This project wouldn't be as neat as it is now if it wasn't thanks to everyone who has helped me

If for some reason you want to add to this abomination, you can do so by adding a pull request and then making a pull request.
If you want to ask about something or give feedback, the best way would probably be to reach me on Discord at ZetDude#4213
or alternatively, if you want to be more formal, I also have kalevbot@gmail.com
